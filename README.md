## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lab you should be able to:

- Use GitHub to structure your work and collaborate with peers (issues, branches, pull requests, and reviews).
- Explain the basic architecture of a real-world digital product in terms of components, data flow, deployment, and tech roles.
- Reflect on your career in tech, examine your current skillset, and plan for the future.

## Tasks overview

To complete this lab, you will need to:

- Set up your `GitHub` account and this lab's repo.
- Pick an existing digital product.
- Sketch its architecture: components, data flow, deployment.
- Map components to tech roles and skills using real job postings and `roadmap.sh`.
- Practice using GitHub issues, branches and pull requests (PRs) to organize your work in a repository (repo) and get feedback from peers.

This and all other lab assignments will simulate real-life engineering practices:

- Follow processes;
- Communicate via issues/PRs;
- Keep the work reviewable;
- Write acceptance criteria;
- Write clear commit messages.

## Repo structure

- [`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml`](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/01-task.yml) - an issue form for a task.
- [`.github/pull_request_template.md`](./.github/pull_request_template.md) - a template for PRs.
- [`./docs/diagrams`](./docs/diagrams) - diagrams of the product's architecture.
- [`./.vscode/settings.json`](./.vscode/settings.json) - `VS Code` settings.
- [`./.vscode/extensions.json`](./.vscode/extensions.json) - recommended `VS Code` extensions.

## Required tasks

> [!TIP]
> **Start here** after completing the [lab setup](#lab-setup).

You work **independently** on the tasks below in your forked repo.

Follow the [procedure for each task](#procedure-for-each-task).

### 1. Pick a product and study its architecture

⏱️ **~30–40 min**

> [!WARNING]
> System architecture diagrams are a part of the architecture documentation and not the [system architecture](https://github.com/inno-se/the-guide?tab=readme-ov-file#architecture).

1. [ ] Create an issue `[Task] Product & architecture description`.
2. [ ] Learn how to [embed images](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images) into your `Markdown` files.
3. [ ] Pick one product from this list:

    - Yandex Go
    - Telegram
    - Wildberries.ru

    Alternatively, choose another full-stack product with at least a million users. In that case, you'll have to [visualize the architecture](./Appendix.md#visualize-the-architecture) on your own.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The provided architecture diagrams are based on educated guesses since the products in the list are mostly closed-source.
   > All diagrams were generated via Gemini 3 Pro (free web version) and edited by the course instructors.

4. [ ] Find the directory with the product's architecture diagrams in two formats:
    - `PlantUML` code in `./docs/diagrams/src/<product-name>`.
    - Rendered architecture diagrams in `./docs/diagrams/out/<product-name>`.

    If you chose another project, provide component, deployment, sequence diagrams in two formats in corresponding directories.

5. [ ] Create `./docs/architecture.md` and add the following contents:
    1. [ ] In the `## Product choice` section:
        - [ ] Provide:
          - [ ] The product's name;
          - [ ] A link to the product's website.
          - [ ] A short description of the product (1–2 sentences).
    2. [ ] In the `## Main components` section:
        > [!NOTE]
        > According to the [`C4 model`](https://c4model.com/abstractions/component), a *component* is a grouping of related functionality encapsulated behind a well-defined interface.
        - [ ] Add the product's `Component Diagram.svg`.
        - [ ] Provide a link to the `PlantUML` code for that [component diagram](./Appendix.md#component-diagram).
        - [ ] Select at least 5 main components of the product from the component diagram.
        - [ ] For each selected component, explain in 1–2 sentences what it does.
    3. [ ] In the `## Data flow` section:
        - [ ] Embed the product's `Sequence Diagram.svg`.
        - [ ] Provide a link to the `PlantUML` code for that [sequence diagram](./Appendix.md#sequence-diagram).
        - [ ] Describe what happens when a typical user action occurs (e.g. a user orders a taxi or sends a message).
        - [ ] Mention which components talk to each other and what kind of data they exchange.
    4. [ ] In the `## Deployment` section:
        - [ ] Embed the product's `Deployment Diagram.svg`.
        - [ ] Provide a link to the `PlantUML` code for that [deployment diagram](./Appendix.md#deployment-diagram).
        - [ ] Briefly describe where the components are deployed.
    5. [ ] In the `## Assumptions and Open Questions` section:
        - [ ] List at least two assumptions you made while describing the architecture.
        - [ ] List at least two questions you couldn't answer from public information.

        Examples:
        - Yandex Go: *"I assumed the rider app talks directly to the driver app, but there's probably a server in between."*
        - Telegram: *"I'm not sure if media files are stored on the same servers as text messages."*
        - Wildberries: *"I don't know if payments are processed by Wildberries or by an external payment service."*

---

### 2. Tech roles involved in the selected product

⏱️ **~20–30 min**

1. [ ] Create an issue `[Task] Roles and skills mapping`.
2. [ ] In `./docs/roles-and-skills.md`:

          ```

     - [ ] In the `## Roles and responsibilities` section:
        - [ ] Select any five roles.
        - [ ] Consult an LLM or search engine to find out what are the typical responsibilities of these roles (what do people holding these role do?).
        - [ ] For each selected role, briefly describe the responsibilities.
     - [ ] In the `## Common skills across roles` section:
       - [ ] Based on your intuition and some research, list **tech skills that are required for these responsibilities**.

    ### Skills that appear in several postings
    <!-- 3-10 skills -->
    - ...
    
    ### Skills specific to a single posting
    <!-- 2-5 skills -->
    - ...

    ```

9. [ ] In `./docs/roles-and-skills.md`, in the `## Personal reflection.` section write 5–10 sentences reflecting on the following questions:
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Write this section **without** an LLM.
